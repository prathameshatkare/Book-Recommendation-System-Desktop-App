Project Title
Books Recommendation System

Overview
This project implements a Books Recommendation System using collaborative filtering. The system analyzes user behavior and recommends books based on similarities between users or books.

Project Files
app.py: This is the main Python script for running the recommendation system. It contains the implementation of the recommendation algorithm and the web application to interact with users.

books_recognition_final.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the detailed analysis and development process of the recommendation system.

books.csv: A dataset containing information about books, including titles, authors, genres, and other relevant details.

books.pkl: Pickle file containing preprocessed book data for faster loading and analysis.

books_list.pkl: Pickle file containing a list of books for reference.

requirements.txt: File specifying the Python dependencies required to run the project. Use pip install -r requirements.txt to install them.

similarity.pkl: Pickle file containing precomputed similarities between books or users, used to enhance recommendation speed.
